        <h1>CommuniKeys (2020)</h1>
        <p>A soft sculpture of a computer keyboard with community-sourced keys. Responding to the prompt "What can our keyboard look like?", ten speculative keys were made from public suggestions to consider how technological interfaces can be made more accessible to the communities that use them. The sculpture takes the form of sewn three-dimensional cushions on a knit frame, installed on a public bench as a backrest cushion.</p>
        <p>This project was produced through Yarn Bombing Los Angeles and exhibited as part of their "Technology and Ethics" outdoor installation at Loyola Marymount University. Special thanks to Darlyn Susan Yee.</p>

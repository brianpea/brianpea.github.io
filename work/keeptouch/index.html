        <h1>Keep Touch (2021)</h1>
        <p>A sculpture made of deconstructed N95 masks. Using a friend's collection of masks amassed from a pandemic-era job, the sculpture reflects on how COVID-19 has undermined conventional structures of support when people needed them the most. The sculpture serves as a reminder to stay intimate, whether physically, emotionally, or collectively.</p>
        <p>This project was produced through Yarn Bombing Los Angeles and exhibited as part of their "Future Tense" outdoor installation at Torrance High School, as part of the Torrance Art Museum's "Ultra!" citywide public arts exhibition. Special thanks to Darlyn Susan Yee and Vidya Palepu.</p>
